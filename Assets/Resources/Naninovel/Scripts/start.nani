The dim room trembles with the sound of wind chimes swaying in the crack of time.
You open your eyes, a deck of divination cards lies before you.
This little house has no door, nor window.
Yet each time the wind chime rings, someone slips through, from another moment in time.

They come with confusion, fear, or desire.
And you, the sole witness of this place, with a few cards in hand, can gently pry open their fate.

Are you ready, fortune teller?
Time is bending, and someone... is being drawn to your guidance.

Four cards materialize before you.
Each one changes something within your guest: Power, Emotion, or Wisdom
and might also alter your own Sanity.
Every visitor has their own wish, hoping to strengthen one or more of these traits.
Fortunately, this time, fate’s alignment is perfect.

No need to hesitate. Start your fortune telling, and read their destiny.

The guest departs.
You can see their attributes shift, and your sanity wavers in response.
Remember, none of their values can fall below zero.
And Sanity, it is the anchor that keeps you in this rift.
When it runs dry, you will no longer know who you are... or who they are.

On the table remain traces: metal dust, an ancient coin, a half-dried tear.
These are the "prices" your guests leave behind.

You must offer them to Time itself, to keep this little house from being swallowed by the void.
Some call it... paying the rent.

This time, fate isn’t so kind.
These cards aren’t enough to fulfill her request.

But destiny is never stingy with chances.
You may lock the Lover card that seems good enough,
and redraw the rest.

The new spread glimmers into existence.
This time, the alignment matches perfectly.
Good. You may begin the reading.

Your rerolls are limited each day.
If no combination feels right, you can always let the guest leave.
Fate always leaves another door open.

Good luck, fortune teller.
Unravel their destinies,
and perhaps, in doing so, uncover your own.
