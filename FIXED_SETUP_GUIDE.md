# ðŸŽ¯ Fixed Setup Guide - Working Demo

## âœ… All Issues Fixed!

### 1. UI Interaction Fixed
- âœ… Added EventSystem for proper UI interaction
- âœ… Added button hover effects (tint colors)
- âœ… Fixed UI layering and raycast issues
- âœ… Created SimpleGameUI that works with CardUISimple

### 2. Card Effects Fixed
- âœ… Fixed CSV format for multiple effects per card
- âœ… Card effects now properly parse (e.g., sun card: wealth+3, sanity+1)
- âœ… Multiple effects per card work correctly

## ðŸš€ How to Set Up & Test

### Option 1: Minimal Test (Recommended First)
1. Create empty scene
2. Add GameObject named "SimpleGameManager"
3. Attach `SimpleGameManager.cs` script
4. Run the game
5. Check Console for success messages
6. Use keyboard controls to test

**Controls:**
- `1-4`: Flip cards
- `Space`: Perform divination
- `N`: Next customer
- `R`: Restart game

### Option 2: Full UI Test
1. Create empty scene
2. Add GameObject named "UISetup"
3. Attach `QuickUISetup.cs` script
4. In Inspector, click "Create Basic UI" button (or check createUI checkbox)
5. UI will be automatically created with proper interaction
6. Test by clicking buttons and cards

### Option 3: Manual UI Setup
1. Create Canvas manually
2. Add GameObject with `SimpleGameUI.cs`
3. Assign UI elements to the script fields
4. Use `CardUISimple` for card components

## ðŸŽ® What Works Now

### Core Game Logic
- âœ… CSV data loading (cards, customers, days)
- âœ… Card drawing and deck management
- âœ… Customer rotation and day progression
- âœ… Divination calculation with multiple card effects
- âœ… Money system and customer satisfaction

### Card Effects Examples
- **Sun Card**: Upright = wealth+3, sanity+1 | Reversed = wealth+1, sanity-4
- **Lover Card**: Upright = relationship+2 | Reversed = relationship-2
- **Moon Card**: Special effects (halve positive/negative effects)
- **Fool Card**: Upright = sanity+3 | Reversed = sanity-2
- **Magician Card**: Upright = wealth+1, relationship+1 | Reversed = wealth-2

### UI Features
- âœ… Clickable cards with hover effects
- âœ… Real-time attribute display
- âœ… Customer information panel
- âœ… Game state tracking (day, money, customer count)
- âœ… Divination result popup
- âœ… Working buttons with proper feedback

## ðŸ”§ Technical Fixes Applied

1. **Escape Character Removal**: Fixed all `\"` issues in strings
2. **EventSystem Addition**: Ensured UI interaction works
3. **Button Color Setup**: Added proper hover/pressed states
4. **CSV Format**: Corrected multiple effects format (pipe-separated)
5. **Component Compatibility**: Created SimpleGameUI for CardUISimple
6. **Raycast Blocker Removal**: Fixed UI layer issues
